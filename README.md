# Graph Utility Snippet

This project provides a utility snippet that simplifies working with graph objects in C++. The snippet includes functions for easy manipulation and traversal of graphs using adjacency matrices and other common representations.

## Features
- Simplified creation of graph objects (Under Development)
- Easy-to-use functions for adding and removing links (Under Development)
- Supports common graph algorithms like Bellman-Ford (Under Development)
- Handles both directed and undirected graphs (Under Development)

## Usage
To use these snippet in your project, simply include the provided file and call the relevant functions to create and manipulate your graphs.

```cpp
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

// Snippets added here

int main() {
    // Your code here
}
```
